# command-line-familiarity

This exercise is designed as a way to get used to using command line. The commands you will need are ls, cd, cat, mkdir, rm and touch or New-Item (depends on the terminal as to which command you'll need).

Follow these steps to begin your quest:

1. **Fork this repository**  
   Click the **Fork** button at the top-right of this page to copy it into your own GitHub account.
2. **Clone your forked repository**  
   Click the **<> Code** button at the top-right of your forked repo and choose Open with GitHub Desktop.
3. **Open the repo in VS Code**
   In GitHub Desktop, click the button to open in VS Code.
4. **Show the terminal**
   From VS Code, in the top toolbar, select View > Terminal.
5. **Begin your quest**
   Find the Instructions.txt file within the treasure_hunt folder. Once you've read these, your mouse is no longer allowed, you must navigate using only commands in the terminal.

Good luck!
