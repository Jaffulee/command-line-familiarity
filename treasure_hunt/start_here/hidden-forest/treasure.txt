Congratulations! You found the treasure!

The golden prize is knowledge! That and another task, of course. 

To complete your quest:
1. Create a folder in the hidden-forest stating your name. The command "mkdir" will be helpful here.
2. Create a file in that new folder rating your experience of the treasure hunt. The command "touch/New-Item" will be helpful here.
3. Be a good citizen and go clean up some rubbish from the beautiful beach. The command "rm" will be helpful here.
